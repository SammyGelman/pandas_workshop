    "\n",
    "    Next we run aggregation methods or agg() on this groupby object.\n",
    "        df.groupby(\"year\").agg('mean')\n",
    "\n",
    "    We can specify which columns we want to work on the same way we would in a DataFrame object:\n",
    "        df.groupby(\"year\")[\"budget_m\"].agg('mean')\n",
    "\n",
    "    We can also run multiple aggregation functions at once and have those be the new column names!\n",
    "    We do this by passing multiple arguments to agg() in the form of a list:\n",
    "        df.groupby(\"year\")[\"budget_m\"].agg(['sum','count','mean'])\n",
    "\n",
    "If a single column is not specified and multiple aggregation methods are used we will get a DataFrame which has a heirarchical index structure. This is not the worst thing but we will avoid it for now. "
